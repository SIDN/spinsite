# TODO

* Lot's of good content
* ~~Different languages? (nl / en)~~
* ~~Proper favicon.~~
* ~~/credits should not open a new tab~~
* ~~404 page does not work multilingual yet~~
  * Fixed with .htaccess-files on server
* ~~menu-footer.html not multilingual yet.~~
  * won't fix
* ~~Clear history has no use, like it does with https://themes.gohugo.io/theme/hugo-theme-learn/~~
  * We use hugo-theme-learn
* ~~Better home-button positioning~~
* check for slug-settings and the proper working of it
* rm *~ prior to publication
* ~~~Dynamic line under links is missing - issue seems to be in theme-[red,blue,green,spin]css~~~
  * See https://github.com/matcornic/hugo-theme-learn/issues/111
* On small screens the menu-icon says 'navigation' in english, should be multilingual
* Write a script to update or insert date: front page matter in .md of choice (like: all), similar to the hugo undraft command
* ~~Lot's of HTML5 errors~~
  * https://html5.validator.nu/
  * Number of fixes applied, some left as they are for now (such as nested p elements, because most browser handle that well)
* Make own version of meta.html with more stuff?
* ~~Fix console error regarding X-Frame-options:~~
  * could not be reproduced
* ~~Cancel hugo-theme-docdoc, we have completely and definitely switched to hugo-theme-learn~~
* Check in different browsers
  * Language arrow down svg looks ugly in Firefox (change into fontawesome?)
    * Does not do the trick - needs further investigation
* Use SIDN fonts?
* Better images (the gui-image has a chrome error, the concept-image a weird white box below 'T' on the very var right)
* chapter h1 too small? CSS seems a bit unclear at first glance
* chapter border-bottom color F0F2F4 is hard to see, change?
* translate slug's into NL where applicable?
* notices are not multilingual
