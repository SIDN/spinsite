# TODO

* Lot's of good content
* Different languages? (nl / en)
* ~~Proper favicon.~~
* ~~/credits should not open a new tab~~
* 404 page does not work multilingual yet
* menu-footer.html not multilingual yet, is this even possible?
* Clear history has no use, like it does with https://themes.gohugo.io/theme/hugo-theme-learn/
* Better home-button positioning
* check for slug-settings and the proper working of it
* rm *~ prior to publication
* ~~~Dynamic line under links is missing - issue seems to be in theme-[red,blue,green,spin]css~~~
  * See https://github.com/matcornic/hugo-theme-learn/issues/111
* On small screens the menu-hamburger says 'navigation' in english, should be multilingual
* Write a script to update or insert date: front page matter in .md of choice (like: all), similar to the hugo undraft command
* Lot's of HTML5 errors https://html5.validator.nu/?doc=https%3A%2F%2Fspin.sidnlabs.nl%2F
