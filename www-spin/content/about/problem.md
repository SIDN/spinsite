#### IoT, the risks
The 'Internet of Things' ([IoT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_of_things)) can make our lives easier in many ways, but unfortunately also involves risks and threats. This certainly also applies to home networks. Security of products by manufacturers often leaves much to be desired. And adequate management by users is often a challenge due to insufficient knowledge and resources.

As a result, security and privacy of the home network are at stake. Vulnerable IoT devices pose two major types of threat. 

1. Theyâ€™re a threat to the internet as a global communications infrastructure, because insecure IoT devices can become part of massive DDoS attacks. 
1. They jeopardise the security, privacy, and perhaps even safety of end-users.
