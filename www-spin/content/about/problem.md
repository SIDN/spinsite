#### Security and privacy in the IoT
While it is anticipated that the [IoT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_of_things) will enable all kinds of new services that will help us in our daily lives, it also poses a security threat because IoT devices are often insecure. This is particularly true for home networks where manufacturers tend to have little interest in securing their products and responsible management by consumers can be a challenge due to a lack of sufficient skills als tools. As a result, security and privacy are at stake.

#### Major security risks
Vulnerable IoT devices pose two major types of threat. 

1. First of all, theyâ€™re a threat to the internet as a global communications infrastructure, because insecure IoT devices can become part of massive DDoS attacks. 
1. The second threat from insecure IoT devices is that they jeopardise the security, privacy, and perhaps even safety of end-users.
