##### How does SPIN relate to the ValiBox?
[ValiBox](https://valibox.sidnlabs.nl/) is a previous project of SIDN Labs. It is a small home router, with a DNSSEC-validating resolver as the most important distinguishing feature. We have taken the ValiBox as a platform to add SPIN functionality to it. Together they form a working whole. But another device can also function as a basis of SPIN. For instance we got SPIN working on a [Turris Omnia](https://omnia.turris.cz/en/) router from NIC.CZ as an experiment. The ValiBox component has thus been replaced by a Turris.

##### Does SPIN do deep packet inspection?
No, but we are researching ways of doing anomaly detection in order to detect malicious behaviour.

##### What about my privacy?
SPIN does all processing locally. Not personal data ever leaves the box. It is important to understand though, that the GUI might reveal surf behaviour of everyone on the network. This can be circumvented by excluding certain devices from the view.

##### Are there similar products?
Yes and we will mention a few of them here soon.

##### Can I join?
Sure! It is all open source. Have a [look here](https://spin4home.nl/cocreation).
