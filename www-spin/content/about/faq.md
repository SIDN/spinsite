##### How does SPIN relate to the ValiBox?
[ValiBox](https://valibox.sidnlabs.nl/) is a previous project of SIDN Labs. It is a small home router, with a DNSSEC-validating resolver as the most important distinguishing feature. We have taken the ValiBox as a platform to add SPIN functionality to it. Together they form a working whole. But another device can also function as a basis of SPIN. For instance we got SPIN working on a [Turris Omnia](https://omnia.turris.cz/en/) router from NIC.CZ as an experiment. The ValiBox component has thus been replaced by a Turris.
