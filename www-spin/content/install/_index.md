# Installing SPIN

There are basically two ways to get and install SPIN:

* By [running pre-built firmware]({{< relref "/install/firmware/_index.md" >}}) images on suitable hardware
* By downloading and [compiling it from source]({{< relref "/install/source/_index.md" >}})

{{% notice warning %}}
Compiling SPIN from source code is recommended to advanced users only.
