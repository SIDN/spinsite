####  ValiBox
SPIN firmware is a further development of an earlier SIDN Labs project called [ValiBox](https://valibox.sidnlabs.nl). Firmware images are available for certain supported [GL-iNet](https://www.gl-inet.com/) devices. In the [requirements section]({{< relref "/install/firmware/requirements.md" >}}) you can find further details about which hardware is supported.

#### Firmware image downloads

The firmware itself can be downloaded from the [beta section](https://valibox.sidnlabs.nl/downloads/valibox/beta/) of the [ValiBox](https://valibox.sidnlabs.nl) site. There are quite some previous versions available in this download directory. Select the latest version. Once you have it installed on a device, it will automatically upgrade itself via a web interface.
