#### Hardware from GL-iNet
Precompiled '[ValiBox with SPIN]({{< relref "/about/faq.md#how-does-spin-relate-to-the-valibox" >}})' firmware images are available for the following [GL-iNet](https://www.gl-inet.com/) devices:

* [GL.iNet6416](https://www.gl-inet.com/gl-inet6416/) (sale is discontinued, supported up until SPIN v1.6)
* [GL-AR150](https://www.gl-inet.com/ar150/) Mini Smart Router
* [GL-AR300M](https://www.gl-inet.com/ar300m/) Mini Smart Router

These devices are running [OpenWRT](https://openwrt.org/).

#### Turris Omnia
We are working on images for the [Turris Omnia](https://omnia.turris.cz/en/) and [Raspberry Pi](https://www.raspberrypi.org/) as well, but they are **not currently available**.

Firmware for the Turris Omnia router will contain standalone SPIN functionality without ValiBox functionality (such as the ValiBox DNSSEC validating resolver with 'negative trust anchor' feature).

* [Turris Omnia](https://omnia.turris.cz/en/) 

This devices also runs [OpenWRT](https://openwrt.org/).

#### Raspberry Pi 3B
<del>We will also create packages for the Rasberry Pi. However, at this moment they are **not available**.</del>

We made a beta-1.7 firmware image for the Raspberri Pi 3B that can be [obtained here](https://valibox.sidnlabs.nl/pages/download.html).

* [RaspberryPi](https://www.raspberrypi.org/)

This devices is running a variant of [Linux](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux).

#### Other
There is an experimental [VirtualBox image available here](https://valibox.sidnlabs.nl/pages/download.html). Let us know how it is of use to you.

If you own different hardware and are interested in having us create firmware for it, please let us know and we will see what we can do.
