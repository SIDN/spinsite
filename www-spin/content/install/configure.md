After you have successfully [installed]({{< relref "/install/_index.md" >}}) SPIN a few more steps are required to get in business.


#### Initial boot

The first time you start the Valibox, it may take a few minutes while the device is getting settled.

1. At some point you should see a new WiFi network called 'SIDN-Valibox-(code)'. The code should match the last 3 letters of the MAC address printed on the bottom of the Valibox. Connect to this network.
1.Open a browser and go to http://valibox.

You should get the following page:

If you get an error '502 Bad Gateway' you may need to wait a little bit longer until the device has finished starting up.

On this screen you can set up 3 things:

1. A new name for the wireless network
1. A password for the wireless network
1. A password to administer the machine

Once this is done, the Valibox will reboot and you are ready to go! :smile:
