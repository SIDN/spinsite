## Vereisten

SPIN is based on the [Valibox](https://valibox.sidnlabs.nl/), a previous project by SIDN Labs, that provided
DNSSEC-validation plus negative trust anchor management on a small home router.

First download the [SPIN binary](https://valibox.sidnlabs.nl/pages/download.html) for your hardware (GL-Inet AR150, 
GL-Inet 6416 or GL-Inet MT300A).
