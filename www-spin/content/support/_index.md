{{%expand "Important note (click to expand):" %}}
We provide SPIN support on a best-effort basis (best-effort in the technical sense, not in the legal sense). Most of it will be free of charge, but we may send you an invoice for our work if (i) your request is specific to your SPIN installation and (ii) if it takes a significant amount of time for us to address. The reason is that we are a small team and dedicated support consumes valuable resource that we prefer to dedicate to the further development of the SPIN platform. We will of course discuss any potential costs with you beforehand.
